When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I have have limited to no access to my own machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be instances where I only need to access certain versions or features of a repository and need not to have every commit that is associated with a certain repository.
